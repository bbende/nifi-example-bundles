        <!-- Processor Documentation ================================================== -->
        <h2>Description:</h2>

        <p>A processor that can rename, or exclude, fields from a JSON document. Renaming fields is
            achieved by providing a comma-separated list mappings from original field name to new
            field name. Excluding fields is achieved by providing a comma separated list of field
            names to exclude.
