<!-- Processor Documentation ================================================== -->
<h2>Description:</h2>

<p>Calls the Twitter Search API with the given query and emits each Tweet as a FlowFile. The content of
each FlowFile will be the JSON representation of the Tweet class from the spring-social-twitter project.
This processor is intended to be scheduled on a timer that executes regularly. Each time the processor
executes it searches for new results since the previous execution, except for the first execution which
grabs the most recent results."</p>
